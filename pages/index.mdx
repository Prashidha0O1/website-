# Prashidha Rawal

gm, I'm Prashidha!

I'm a full-stack developer specializing in React.js, Rust, React-Native, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. I have a passion for Web3 development and enjoy building decentralized applications on the Solana blockchain.

I've worked on several innovative projects, including "Sol-Up," a marketplace for startups where investors can fund projects and receive NFTs in return. Iâ€™m currently building a decentralized crowdfunding platform that supports live auctions on platforms like YouTube, X, and Twitch.

Apart from coding, Iâ€™m an avid learner of new technologies and am currently diving deep into the Rust programming language ðŸ¦€. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and am always looking to collaborate with like-minded developers.

Beyond the keyboard, I have a keen interest in reading books, writing poetry.

Let's connect, build, and learn together!
